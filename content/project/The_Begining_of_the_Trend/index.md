summary: "Recent research argues the decline in real interest rates led to a large rise in economic profits and markups over the past several decades. We show the size of these estimates is sensitive to the sample start date: In a leading example, the rise in markups from 1981 to 2014 is 26% lower than from 1984 to 2014. This difference amounts to about $4 thousand per worker in 2014. The sensitivity comes from a peak in real interest rates in 1984."
