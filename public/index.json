Introduction\rFlight delays can be extremely frustrating, especially given the difficulty that consumers can face when trying to predict what factors might make a flight more or less delayed. Being able to predict how late a flight is based on a set of controllable factors would be extremely valuable. Hence, in this project we will attempt to create a model to predict flight delays, using a set of variables that could realistically be controlled by a prospective consumer.\nWe will be using the variables Month, Day, Day of the Week, Airline, Origin, Destination, Distance, Scheduled Departure. While this set contains observations from airports across the country, it does not seem reasonable to assume that a consumer could leave from any airport that they wanted. Hence, we will be using a subset of our original data set containing only flights from Oakland, San Francisco, and San Jose. While this limits the predictive power for non-Bay Area fliers, we hope that a similar model could be created to suit the needs of passengers leaving from other locations. Moreover, we will not be using all of the variables in our data set, instead opting to begin by modeling using the month, the day of the week, the airline being flown with, the origin airport (OAK, SFO, or SJC), the destination airport, the scheduled departure (in 24 hour time), and the distance being flown. Our thinking is that these are all variables that could be reasonably controlled by a consumer when choosing a flight.\nSince our end-user is a traveler and not a government agency, only a subset of all the variables in our dataset is relevant to answering our research question. A is deciding where to book their ticket and from which airline to do so. They do not have access to information such as actual arrival times, taxi times, reasons for the delay, and other variables like such. A typical user will not have the ability nor the reason to consider these exogenous variables. Taxi time for example is a factor of how busy an airport is, how many planes are allowed in the sky at one time, the season, the weather, the economy, the number of operating airlines, proximity to a city, and various other factors that someone booking a trip will not go through the extreme research lengths to make a decision.\nBy regressing on the airport (both the destination and departure), we are implicitly able to capture these generalized variables. Likewise, variations in season and holidays are also implicitly captured by Month, Day, and Day of the week since our dataset is restricted to a single year.\nOur report will be structured as follows. Section II will be devoted to a brief discussion of the data, its distributions, its limitations, and some transformations we will be applying to it. Section III will discuss our model, and how we came to it. Section IV will be devoted to testing our model and discussing our overall results. Finally, section V will be our conclusion, where we will discuss the results of this testing and possible next steps.\nII. Data Description\rOur data is provided by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The DOT Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights are published in the DOT‚Äôs monthly Air Travel Consumer Report where this dataset of 2015 flight delays and cancellations is sourced. The original dataset contains nearly 6 million observations. While this may prove useful about establishing trends about airline on-time performance nationally, for the focus of this project we will only consider flights originating from the 3 major airports of the Bay Area: San Francisco International Airport (SFO), Oakland International Airport (OAK), and Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport (SJC).\nIII. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing\rAfter extracting all the flight data from SFO, OAK, and SJO, we noticed that there are rows with missing values. This could potentially be the result of human error or data discrepancies across different airports or airlines. To mitigate this issue of regressing on missing values, we took the step of removing all rows with null or missing values. We then removed all the flights that are canceled since a canceled flight should not be part of the model predicting arrival delays. Lastly, we one-hot encoded all of our categorical variables from the last section, creating dummy variables for each airline, month, and day of the week.\nAdditionally, while this is technically data modification, it was in this step that we discovered that for whatever reason the DOT data that we acquired did not have correct departure airports for October (they were all given in the form of 5 digit numbers that we could not link to any airports). For that reason, October is not included in our analysis.\nIV. EDA\rWe begin our EDA by looking at the distribution of flight delays.
